# DS/Algo : The Data Science Style

Data Science and Machine Learning is one of the fields where the diversity in people is immense . People come from various backgrounds like Mathematics , Chemistry , Finance and even from non-tech backgrounds like Pyschology etc , while Python and other Data Science libraries/tools make it easy for people to transition into this beautiful field , Data Science still belongs to Advanced Computer Science Domain , this makes it necessary for Data Scientists too , to have necessary Computer Science Skills

One of the most important things in core computer science is Data Structures and Algorithms and is a must if you are aiming for ever working in a big company like Microsoft , Google , Apple ,etc . But unfortunately the topic can get very intimidating real quick , having faced such difficulties myself , I wondered what could be an easy way to make these concepts understand to people who are just getting started with programming that too in core python and AS a result I bring this track to you

The key here is to learn only the things that are absolute must and in a specific order and in a way that is relatable to data science , so if you are interested you can follow along
